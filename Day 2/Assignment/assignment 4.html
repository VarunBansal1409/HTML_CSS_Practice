    <h1>Welcome to Full Stack Development

    </h1>
     <p class="demo">Full stack development refers to building both the front end (user interface) and back end (server, database, and logic) of a web application. The front end involves using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the parts users see and interact with. The back end uses languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP to handle data processing, server communication, and database operations. A full stack developer is skilled in both areas, allowing them to build complete, fully functional web applications from start to finish.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to HTML Headings
        </h2>
        <p class="demo">
            HTML headings are used to define the titles and main points of content on a web page. There are six levels of headings, ranked from the most important to the least important. The first level is the main heading of the page, often used for titles or key topics. The following levels are used for subheadings, helping to organize content in a clear, structured way. Headings also improve accessibility and help search engines understand the layout and importance of the content on the page. Using headings correctly makes a web page easier to read and navigate.
