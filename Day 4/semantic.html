          <h3>Naruto</h3>
          <p>
            Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
            Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young
            ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming
            the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two
            parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27),
            and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on
            two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned
            Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
            the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in
            Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September
            1999 to November 2014, with its 700 chapters collected in 72
            tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American
            production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump
            magazine. The manga was adapted into two anime television series by
            Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran from October 2002 to March 2017 on TV
            Tokyo. Pierrot also produced 11 animated films and 12 original video
            animations (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games,
            and trading cards. The story continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son
            Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja path instead of following his
            father's.

        <h3>Sasuke</h3>
        <p>
          Sasuke Uchiha (Japanese: うちは サスケ, Hepburn: Uchiha Sasuke)
          (/ˈsɑːskeɪ/) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime
          franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto. Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha
          clan, a notorious ninja family, and one of the most powerful, allied
          with Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里; English version: "Hidden Leaf
          Village"). Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older
          brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke as one
          of the few survivors. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates
          Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness
          force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become
          stronger than Itachi, and to find Orochimaru. Sasuke appears in
          several of the series' animated feature films and related media,
          including video games, original video animations (OVAs), and Boruto:
          Naruto the Movie (2015) and its manga sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next
          Generations (2016), in which he is depicted as a vigilante supporting
          his village and a mentor to Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki. Kishimoto
          conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto
          Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark character development later in the
          story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found
          designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a
          suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy
          drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by
          Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.
